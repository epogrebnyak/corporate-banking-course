- Financial institutions control 35% of firms in Belgium, 30% in Sweden, 25% in Finland and Germany, 20% in Portugal, 15% in Spain and 10% in Argentina and Norway.

- Shareholders prefer to assume higher risk than lenders, whereas lenders prefer firms to maximize the probability of repayment.

- Hypothesis:

    - `H1a`: Banks stock ownership has a positive influence on debt and debt maturity and a negative effect on debt cost if the monitoring effect is prevalent.

    - `H1b`: Banks stock ownership has a negative influence on debt and debt maturity and a positive effect on debt cost if the expropriation effect is prevalent.


Result:

- Debt maturity increases with bank ownership, whereas the cost of debt decreases with bank ownership.These results are consistent with the predominance of the monitoring effect over the expropriation effect.
