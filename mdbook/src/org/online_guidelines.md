### Guidelines for courses

- Log in into the system under your first and last name.

- More beforehand reading / material should be supplied, please review it. 

- Please show up on a video at least several times a lecture (17.30, 19.15),
  for attendance credit and easier identification - still do not know you by face/name.

- Provide feedback: 
  - написать в чат
  - задать вопрос или ответить голосом
  - заполнить быстрый ответ в систему домашнего задания (quick homework)

- We shall need to seek a balance in feedback and communication (not too much,
  not too little). The online lecture is not a well-prepared show (at least yet), 
  be ready for things not working as expected, participate in fixing them.
