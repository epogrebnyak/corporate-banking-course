# [Does Borrowing from Banks Cost More than Borrowing from the Market? (2019)](https://memento.epfl.ch/public/upload/files/PaperSchwert.pdf)

This  paper  investigates  the  pricing  of  bank  loans  in  a  sample  of  new  loans  to  firmswith  outstanding  bonds.  After  accounting  for  seniority,  banks  earn  an  economically large interest rate premium relative to the price of credit risk in the bond market. To establish this result, I use intuition from a reduced-form model of credit risk to show that average  loan  spreads  are  three  times  higher  than  implied  by  bond  spreads  and relative  losses  in  default. 

To  quantify  the  premium  at  the  loan  level,  I  apply  a structural model to a subsample of secured term loans and estimate an average loanpremium of 240 bps. I rule out general mispricing of seniority, liquidity, fixed costs,and capital charges as drivers of the premium. My findings imply that firms place ahigh value on bank services other than the simple provision of debt capital.
