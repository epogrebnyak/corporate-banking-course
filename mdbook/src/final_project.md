# Final project

(for discussion)

Data-intensive / computational - can you handle it?

Core tasks:

- create and simulate a loan portfolio
- use both data on companies and data on banks to calibrate
- add heterogenity to loan terms
- perform a stress test
- report results

Additional:

- suggest early warning indicators for default 
- make a simple loan pricing mechanism
