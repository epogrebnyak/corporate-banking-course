## Types of loans and firm constraints

## Loan types

From statistics we see just exposures at some date (eg. end of quarter).

Underlying contracts may vary in following dimnsions:

1. Term/installment ("кредит") vs revolver (кредитная линия):

- fixed schedule and fixed amount (term loans)
- flexible schedule and capped amount(revolver, line of credit)

2. Seniority (старшинство)

- secured, senoir/junior (has priority in bankruptcy), 
- subordinated (priority in default and can count in capital calcultaion)

3. Colateral (залог)

- pledge of specific assets as a repayment guarantee
- example: [commercial business mortage](https://www.santanderbank.com/us/business/borrowing/commercial-real-estate-mortgages)

4. Lender group

- single lender
- group of lenders (syndicated loans)
- transferable to other lender or not (CDO, collaterlised debt obligations) 

5. Linkage to specific activity or business segment

Current business:

- fixed asset investment
- working capital
- trade finance
- general corporate needs

Corporate restructuring:

- LBO (leveraged buyout)
- recapitalisation

Other purposes

6. Covenants (ковенанты/дополнительные условия)

- example: *convenant-lite* loan 

7. New origination or repayment of existing loans

8. Guarantees (off balance sheet):

- LOC (letter of credit)
- guarantee


Some dimensions may overlap or may compose, eg *trade finance* - has specific business segment and it has colateral (receivables or inventory).

See if our classification holds for:

- factoring
- leasing
- forfeiting

- Asset-based vs cash-flow based lending
- *Earnings-based constraint (EBC)*

> Commercial  loans  are  typically  organized  in  a  package  that  shares  the  same covenants:  the  package commonly contains a revolving credit line, which can be asset-based (secured by inventory and receivable), and cash flow-based term loans.  Thus the revolving lines are also associated with earnings-based covenantsalthough we categorize them into asset-based lending.
