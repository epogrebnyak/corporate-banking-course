## Flow of funds (FoF)

Introductory notes:

- part of or extenstion of system of national accounts (link to [SNA refresher](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/sna-ru/handout/index.html)):  
  `gross savings = fixed cap investment + net lending + stat discrepancy`
- balance sheet (stock) and transaction (flows) tables
- sectors x instruments table (*'2d'*), sectors x instruments x sectors table (*'3d'*)
- valuation at market prices (different view on book value in corporate reports)
- `closing stock = opening stock + flow + revaluation + other changes (eg. writeoff)`

Expected takeaways:

- bank-based (loan) vs market-based (bonds) financial system
- size of corporate debt (loans and bonds)
- more debt instruments (several types of loans, trade credit)
- cautious about:
  - equity shows at market, not book value 
  - aggregation vs consolidation of exposures
  - nonfinancial sector net position (net worth)
- discussion on what is missing in FoF statistics and where to find it
