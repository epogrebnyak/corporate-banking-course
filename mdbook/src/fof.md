## Flow of funds

Introductory notes:

- extenstion of system of national accounts (link to refresher):  
  `gross savings = fixed cap investment + net lending + stat discrepancy`
- balance sheet (stock) and transaction (flows) tables
- sectors * instruments table
- valuation at market prices (different view on book value in corporate reports)
- `closing stock = opening stock + flow + revaluation + other changes (eg. writeoff)`

[Excel file](fof.xls) (links inside):

- US
- Euro area
- Japan
- Russia

Expected takeaways:

- bank-based (loan) vs market-based (bonds) financial system
- size of corporate debt (loans and bonds)
- more debt instruments (several types of loans, trade credit)
- cautious about nonfinancial sector net position and equity valuation
- discussion on what is missing in statistics and where to find it
