- Loans by female borrowers and borrowers screened and monitored by female 
  loan officers are less likely to turn problematic.
  
- We find that female loan officers experience a lower share of problem 
  loans both in the case of male and of female borrowers.
  
- The effects are much stronger and more robust for first loans than for 
  subsequent loans to the same borrower.

- Female loan officers are not better because they are more experienced. Female loan 
  officers are, on average, roughly two years younger than their male counterparts.

*Tentative conclusion*

- Better performance of female loan officers is explained with 
  better screening capacities on unobserved borrower characteristics (smell test) and/or 
  better monitoring capacities.
