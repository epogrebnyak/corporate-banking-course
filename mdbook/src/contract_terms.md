- We find strong interrelationships between contract terms with significant bi-directional relationships between duration and secured status and between the all-in-spread and commitment fees and a unidirectional relationship from both duration and secured status to all-in-spread.

Notes:

- Melnik and Plaut (1986) characterize bank commitment contracts as providing a package of n-contract terms that cannot be split and traded separately.

- "underinvestment problem", as in [Determinants of Corporate Borrowing (1977)](https://www2.bc.edu/thomas-chemmanur/phdfincorp/MF891%20papers/Myers%201977.pdf) by SC Myers
