<p><strong>Description of course methodology</strong></p>
<p>We intend to supplement key topics with an in class data exercise or homework assignment, followed by student presentation in class. The data exercises are exploratory in nature, and the class presentations should help share the ideas that students are expected to formulate and summarize in a final essay.</p>
<p>Part of the class time can be devoted to invited presentations and panel discussions with corporate banking practitioners.</p>

<p>The suggested reading list and data sources will be provided by topic. We aim to keep technical detail low in order to make material more accessible (example - <a href="%5d(https:/voxeu.org/article/how-much-capital-should-banks-have"><span class="underline">capital adequacy reading</span></a>).</p>
<p>Overall review of principal topics can be found in European Banking Authority (EBA) 2019 consultation paper <a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/2831176/3bc64e01-a4d1-4c7e-92d4-1dd84f4b234c/CP%20on%20GLs%20on%20loan%20origination%20and%20monitoring.pdf"><span class="underline">Draft Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring</span></a>.
