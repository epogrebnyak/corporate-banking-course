Description of course methodology
=================================

We intend to supplement key topics with an in class data excercise or homework assignment, with results to be presented by students in class. The data excercises are exploratory in nature, The class presentations should 
help share the ideas that students would summarise in a final essay.

To share hands-on business experience part of the class time can be devoted to invited lectures and panel discussions with corporate banking practitioners.

Course materials
===============-

The suggested reading list and data sources will be provided by topic. We shall aim
to keep technical detail low in order to make material more accessible
(example - [capital adequacy reading](https://voxeu.org/article/how-much-capital-should-banks-have)). 

Overall review of principal topics covered in the course can be found in European Banking Authority (EBA) 2019 consultation paper [Draft Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring](https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/2831176/3bc64e01-a4d1-4c7e-92d4-1dd84f4b234c/CP%20on%20GLs%20on%20loan%20origination%20and%20monitoring.pdf). 

Earlier, but very readable and more detailed source is OeNB/FMA (Austria) [Credit Approval Process and Credit Risk Management guidelines](https://www.fma.gv.at/download.php?d=181), published in 2004.

Preparation for several excercises will include Python scripts for data downloading and filtering. Students can use software of their choice for analysing the provided datasets 
(eg Excel, Python, R or other).
